This research aimed to use a binary classification job to forecast whether or not clients would default on credit card payments. For six months, the dataset comprised payment information for 30,000 Taiwanese clients, including credit limit, gender, education, marital status, age, repayment status, bill statements, and total amount paid.
Several models were used to solve the classification challenge, including Trivial, Nearest Means, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, K nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks. The training dataset had 27,000 data points, while the testing dataset had 3,000. The training dataset's class distribution was examined better to understand the balance of default and non-default occurrences.
